Hello, if anyone is reading this it means someone actually decided to pay a visit, which is a surprise to me but hey, here we are.

This is not a real project or a system designed to serve one single function. Its just a tiny compilation of coding ideas for simple apps which will help me grow as a developer.
This code will function normally within its own files, and if i have a multiple files project in here, it will probably be a front side to some processing thing.


If you're willing to send tips on how to improve some code, they'll be more than welcomed.
